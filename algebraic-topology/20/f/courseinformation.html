    <h3> Prerequisites </h3>
    This course will require a higher level of mathematical maturity than an
    undergraduate course. First it requires knowledge of, or willingness to
    learn, material from a typical grad-school-prep undergrad curriculum. For
    us, some basic point-set topology and algebra will be helpful. Second, you
    will also need to have the ability to locate and learn some theorems on your
    own. I will try and give you guys good references but sometimes what I
    provide won't be perfect and you will need to cobble some things together.
    Finally, as a fair warning, I'm trying to cut out a path in a ton of
    material in one semester. A typical graduate Geometry-Topology sequence is
    two semesters,&nbsp; and there is enough material here to easily take up
    four semesters. I don't expect things to be in an optimal order my first
    time teaching and I don't expect to finish everything.<br>
    <h3> Grading </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Grading will be based on homework assignments. They will typically be
        due on Fridays (probably not every Friday).</li>
      <li> You may work with others and consult references but you must write
        the homework using your own words and you must cite your sources
        (including collaborators)!</li>
    </ul>
