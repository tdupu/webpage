This course                forms the basis for the continued study of the basic algebraic                structures (groups, rings, and fields) in the sequel: Math 252.              </p>              <p> Your grade in this course will be determined on the basis of                homework (80%) and participation (20%). </p>              <p>Due to COVID, homework is going to be rolling. To accommodate                this, we have set up Guidelines for the preparation of homework                can be found here: </p>              <p> <a href="homework_guidelines.html">Guidelines for Homework                  Assignments </a> </p>              <p> Exams may be rescheduled only for compelling, legitimate, and                documented reasons. In general, if it is necessary to miss an                exam your grade will be determined on the basis of your other                work. </p>              <p> Collaboration on homework is both allowed and encouraged -                discussing solutions to mathematics problems is one of the best                ways to learn mathematics. Any work submitted must be your own                and honest - for example, you must write up your own solutions                and be prepared to publicly defend in class any solution you                submit. Any joint work should be acknowledged explicitly.                Solutions simply copied from some other source without                attribution are intellectually dishonest and can be the grounds                for dismissal. </p>              <hr>              <p> </p>            </li>          </font>          <li><font color="#000000"><b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b> Students are expected              to observe appropriate codes of conduct.
