Thoughtful reviews    should be pinpoint accurate and not be offensive to the reader. <br>    <h3> Common Mistakes </h3>    Here is an incomplete list of common mistakes. If you have more that you    want me to add, let me know!<br>    <ol>      <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_example.%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">Proofs          by Example </a> </li>      <li> Proofs that don't use all of the hypotheses of the problem. </li>      <li> Illegal assumptions. "Suppose... (thing you are definitely not        allowed to do)". </li>      <li>incorrect terminology: "expands to", "let" instead of "if", </li>      <li>undefined terminology or notation: the letter "k" appears in the proof        but k is defined nowhere. </li>      <li>Arguing by assuming an equation is true. 1=-1, (1)^2 = (-1)^2, 1 = 1,        so we conclude 1=-1. </li>      <li>Unjustified steps. </li>      <li> Missing parts: no base case of induction, not proving one direction        in an "iff" statement, skipping a letter of a problem (if it asks to        prove (a),(b),(c) but the author only proves (a) and (b).)      </li>      <li> Expressions that are floating on the page and appear to have nothing        to do with what is going on. </li>    </ol>    <h3> Example Feedback </h3>    Below we give some examples of what appropriate scores and commentary could    look like for some problems from Dummit and Foote. <br>    <h4> 1.1: 1(c,e), 2(c,e) 3(c,e,f) </h4>    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td><b>Score</b></td>          <td><b>Comments</b></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>8</td>          <td>For (1c), it is true that division is not associative, but this            isn't what we are considering. <br>            Proof omits (6f).</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>10</td>          <td>Small mistake on division associativity. </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>6</td>          <td>no proofs, one "proof by example".</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>7</td>          <td>In (1c) you are working with the wrong operation.<br>            In (6) you aren't checking closure.</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>10</td>          <td>We say "…is closed under addition" not "…is close under addition".</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h4> 1.1: 31 </h4>    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td><b>Score</b></td>          <td><b>Comments</b></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>8</td>          <td>Proof never draws the conclusion it should. </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>5</td>          <td>The proof repeats part of what is supposed to be proved but makes            no reference to t(G) or its complement.</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>7</td>          <td>The language is imprecise.
