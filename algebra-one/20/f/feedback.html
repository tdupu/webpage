<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">    <title>Feedback Examples</title>  </head>  <body> Reviews are at the discretion of the reviewer (although I reserve the    right to implement software for reviewing reviews). Thoughtful reviews    should be pinpoint accurate and not be offensive to the reader. <br>    <h3> Common Mistakes </h3>    Here is an incomplete list of common mistakes. If you have more that you    want me to add, let me know!<br>    <ol>      <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_example.%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">Proofs          by Example </a> </li>      <li> Proofs that don't use all of the hypotheses of the problem. </li>      <li> Illegal assumptions. "Suppose... (thing you are definitely not        allowed to do)". </li>      <li>incorrect terminology: "expands to", "let" instead of "if", </li>      <li>undefined terminology or notation: the letter "k" appears in the proof        but k is defined nowhere. </li>      <li>Arguing by assuming an equation is true. 1=-1, (1)^2 = (-1)^2, 1 = 1,        so we conclude 1=-1. </li>      <li>Unjustified steps. </li>      <li> Missing parts: no base case of induction, not proving one direction        in an "iff" statement, skipping a letter of a problem (if it asks to        prove (a),(b),(c) but the author only proves (a) and (b).)      </li>      <li> Expressions that are floating on the page and appear to have nothing        to do with what is going on. </li>    </ol>    <h3> Example Feedback </h3>    Below we give some examples of what appropriate scores and commentary could    look like for some problems from Dummit and Foote. All feedback should technically be addressed to the editor (me). <br>    <h4> 1.1: 1(c,e), 2(c,e) 3(c,e,f) </h4>    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td><b>Score</b></td>          <td><b>Comments</b></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>8</td>          <td>For (1c), it is true that division is not associative, but this            isn't what they are supposed to be considering. <br>            Proof omits (6f).</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>10</td>          <td>Small mistake on division in associativity proof. </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>6</td>          <td>no proofs, the second part is a "proof by example".</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>7</td>          <td>In (1c) they are working with the wrong operation.<br>            In (6) they don't check the closure operation.</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>10</td>          <td> We say "…is closed under addition" not "…is close under addition".</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h4> 1.1: 31 </h4>    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td><b>Score</b></td>          <td><b>Comments</b></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>8</td>          <td>Proof never draws the conclusion it needs to in order to complete the problem. </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>5</td>          <td>The proof repeats part of what is supposed to be proved but makes            no reference to t(G) or its complement.</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>7</td>          <td>The language is imprecise.
